# Spaceship Game

A simple 2D python game designed to teach you the pygame module created by techwithtim.

I have completed this project following techwithtim's tutorial on his Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY) and made some minor modifications. 
This was in order to become more familiar with the Pygame module and experiment a little bit with its possibilities. I have also added some comments to make the script 
easier to follow and changed some of the naming conventions.

The scripts touches the basics of pygame, such as naming your pygame window, drawing elements on it and updating their positions, handling collisions between rectangle 
objects, adding sound effects and text, handling winning conditions and linking object movement to keyboard presses. 

I have chosen this particular module since games are inehrently complex, feature a lot of object oriented programming, often the scripts are distributed over different 
files, have to deal with local and global variables carefully in order to handle game files correctly with multiple functions and methods at the same time, handling 
closing a window and terminating a program, having to use multimedial resources such as pictures and sound effects and linking those to specific actions. I strongly 
believe games to be a tremendous opportunity to learn a lot when it comes to programming.
